PARL is a custom programming language and compiler developed as a school project using Python. The project was built to explore language design and compiler construction from the ground up.

It includes a full pipeline: a lexer, parser, type checker, and code generator. The language supports variables, functions, control flow (if, while), arrays, and basic type checking.

Code is parsed into an abstract syntax tree and then processed through semantic analysis and code generation for execution.

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with the inner workings of compilers, from tokenization to code execution.
